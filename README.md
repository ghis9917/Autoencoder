First Assignment of the course of Advanced Concept in Machine Learning, UM, 2020

The assignments requires the development of a basic Neural Network (8 - 3 - 8) whose goal is to replicate a given input.\
The inputs provided are binary arrays of fixed length (8) where online one "bit" is turned on.

The result is an autoencoder capable of compressing information in the hidden node and restore in the output one.
